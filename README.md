# Queue-Simulator
> 2 days of hard working a well developed, structured and documented app to be 100% free of bugs.
> GUI Queue simulation &amp; analytical modelling of a multi-server using markovian queuing theory,
> the application let you conduct markovian queuing theory on graphical user interface and field entry bases,
> where simulation customers is visualised as graphics of baskets and servers as checkouts.
